						<h1>Nitrous.io</h1>
						<p>Next, we need a Nitrous.io account.</p>
            <hr>
						<p>Normally, developers install software on their computer and use Terminal<br> and a text editor to write code. This is perfectly OK, but it takes<br> a bit more time to set up.</p>
						<hr>
            <p>We're going to use a shortcut by coding in Nitrous.io.</p>
						<p>This means we can start making magic straight away.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
						<h1>Go to <a href="http://nitrous.io" target="_blank">http://nitrous.io</a></h1>

						<p>Tell Nitrous your email address.</p><p> Pick a username, and choose a password.</p>

						<p>Click the signup button.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>You'll receive a confirmation email.</h2>
          <h3>Click the confirmation link.</h3>
					<h2>You will be taken back to Nitrous.io.</h2>

          <h2>Click 'Authorize Application'.</h2>
					<p>Then, in Nitrous.io, click 'Next'.
				</section>
				<section>
						<p>We don't need a special app (we'll use your browser), but later,<br> you might like use the Nitrous app with a text editor instead.</p><p>Or, you might like to <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/">set up a full installation</a></p>
						<p>Click the 'Take me to my box' button.</p>
						<p>You're now ready to start making your app!.</p>

				</section>
				<!-- Create project files and app directories -->
				<section>
						<p>First, we're going to make somewhere to store our app</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In Nitrous, the boxes at the bottom of the page are your Terminal.</p>
					<p>Your Terminal is used to write commands that control<br> the server, the files you're creating and your database</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We need to create some folders to store our app in. In the terminal type:</p>
					<pre><code>mkdir projects</code></pre>
					<p>The 'mkdir' command means 'make directory'.<br> So, we've made a directory called 'projects'.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now, we need to access the directory we made. In the terminal type:</p>
					<pre><code>cd projects</code></pre>
					<p>The 'cd' command means 'change directory'.<br> We're now in the 'projects' directory.</p>
					<p>The 'projects' directory is usually used to<br> store all your different coding projects.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We're going to make an app called Rails Girls. In the terminal type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails new railsgirls</code></pre>
					<p>The 'rails new' command creates a new rails app.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Let's change directory into our new app. In the terminal type:</p>
					<pre><code>cd railsgirls</code></pre>
				</section>
				<!-- Test Server -->
				<section>
					<p>To check we've set up our app correctly, let's start the server. In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails server</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Our server will now start up.<br> You'll notice that the terminal now looks a bit different.<br> Instead of our directory name, it just shows this:
					</p>
					<pre><code>$              </code></pre>
					<p>While the server is running in this page of the terminal,<br> we can't type any other commands in.<br> We can open a second tab in the terminal by clicking the '+' button.
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Let's check to make sure our server is running properly</p>
					<p>In the menu bar at the top of the Nitrous window, click 'preview', and choose 'Port 3000'
					<p><img src="images/serverpreview.png"></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>A new tab will open in your browser.
					</p>
					<p>This should say "Welcome Aboard"
					</p>
					<p>Don't have this? Get a coach to help check it out.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Great. We now have a working server. Let's shut it down (for now) and start work</p>
					<p>Go back to the Nitrous.io tab.</p>
					<p>Click the terminal, and hit 'Ctrl' + C.</p>
					<p>This will stop the server</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>So, web apps?</h2>
						<p>When we create websites, we store them on a server. When you go to view a website, a bunch of different things happen to show you the page.</p>
						<p>Know how websites work already?</p>
						<p><a href="#" class="navigate-right">Yes</a></p>
						<p><a href="#" class="navigate-down">No</a></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ol>
							<li>You type the address in (or click a link) in your browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer)</li>
							<li>Your browser asks a server for the information that makes up that page.</li>
							<li>The server sends the information back to your browser</li>
							<li>Your browser shows you the page</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>When we're building our website, we're making the stuff on the server (step 3). Our web app will also need to store data, so it will have a database.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Our web app needs to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Listen for requests from browsers</li>
							<li>Store and retrieve any information the browser sends to it</li>
							<li>Send back the information required. This might include retrieving things stored in our database</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The information we send back to the browser has to be in a format the browser can read and display. This is normally HTML, as well as some CSS (to make our page look pretty, and Javascript (to make things like forms work).</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Let's take a look at what's in the app we just set up.
					</p>
					<p>In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>ls</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You'll see a list of all the different things in your new app</p>
					<pre><code>app  bin  config  config.ru  db  Gemfile  Gemfile.lock  lib  localhost:3000  log  public  Rakefile  README.md  README.rdoc  test  tmp  vendor </code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Let's get building.</h2>
					<p>One of the great things about Rails is that it comes with some built-in things that make it super easy to get going. One of these is scaffolds. Scaffolds let you easily add new concepts (like users, posts and comments) in one command.</p>
					<p>The scaffold command creates all the necessary code files you need to work with that concept. This includes database tables to store information in, and instructions for how it needs to interact with other parts of your app</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In the terminal, type:<p>
					<pre><code>rails generate scaffold idea name:string description:text picture:string</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You've now create a concept (model) called 'idea' that includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A name</li>
						<li>A description</li>
						<li>A picture</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The 'string' and 'text' parts tell the app what type of data it will be.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>There are lots of different types of data you might include, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>:binary</code> - stores data such as images, audio files or movies</li>
						<li><code>:boolean</code> - stores true or false values (such as whether a particular user is an administrator of an application or not)</li>
						<li><code>:date</code> - stores only a date (year, month, day)</li>
						<li><code>:datetime</code> - stores both a date and a time</li>
						<li><code>:integer</code> - stores whole numbers</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>When we add new concepts like these to our app, we need to update our database. This is called a migration.</p>
					<p>In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>rake db:migrate</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>There's also a command to reverse the migration if you make a mistake: </p>
					<pre><code>rake db:rollback</code></pre>
					<p>If you've heard developers talking about a 'rollback', this is what they mean.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Let's restart our server and see what that made.</p>
					<p>In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails server</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Open the preview on Port:3000 again.</p>
					<p>The address in the browser will be yourappname.nitrousbox.com. Add '/ideas' to the end of the URL</p>
					<p>You'll now be able to see the basics of the app you're creating!</p>
					<p>If you can't see your app, ask a coach for help.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>It looks pretty plain right now, but click around and explore what you've built.</p>
					<p>Once you've had a play, go back to your Nitrous.io editor.</p>
					<p>Stop the server by clicking in the terminal and typing CTRL + C.</p>

				<!-- Design/Front-end -->
				<section>
					<h2>Making things beautiful </h2>
					<h4>(or, the front-end)</h4>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In a Ruby on Rails application, the user interface (what someone visiting the website will see), is often written in HTML with Embedded Ruby (ERB) code.</p>
					<p>This code is contained in a specific directory called ‘views’, located in the app folder of your Rails application directory.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the main language used to write the things displayed in a web browser. HTML includes content, and tags to structure the content. These tags come in pairs (an open and a close tag). For example, the main heading on your page will have <code>&lt;h1&gt;tags&lt;/h1&gt;</code> around it.</p>
					<p>HTML tags use angular brackets <code> < ></code>.</p>
					<p>Your web browser uses the tags to understand how to display content.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>ERB is a system supplied by Ruby that allows you to insert pure Ruby code into files written in other languages, such as Javascript or HTML. The Ruby code is contained within specific angle brackets <code><%</code> and <code>%></code> which instruct the system to execute the contents.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>If an = sign accompanies the angle brackets <code><%=</code> and <code>%></code> then the contents are executed and rendered on the page.</p>
					<p>For example, if you had 25 active ideas in your application, the code:</p>
					<pre><code>There are currently <%= Idea.count %> active ideas</code></pre>
					<p>would render as: There are currently 25 active ideas</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Earlier, we ran a scaffold command to set up our app. As well as creating our model, it also created a controller, and a view.</p>
					<p>When someone connects to your Rails website, the request the browser sends to the server hits the controller you've created. The controller communicates with the model (and the model with the database) to get the information needed. It then sends that information to the view, which returns the HTML to the requesting browser, so they can see your site.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>All the things we've talked about so far involve the content of our website, and the structure of that content.</p>
					<p>The next piece of the puzzle is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is used to format/style our website, so that it looks beautiful and is nice to use.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In Nitrous.io, the left side of the page has a tree menu. Use this to open <code>app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</code> in your text editor. This is a default layout file. You can use this to create default formatting for your app.
					</p>
					<p>Find the line <code><%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %></code>. Above this line, add this code:</p>
					<pre><code><link rel="stylesheet" href="//railsgirls.com/assets/bootstrap.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//railsgirls.com/assets/bootstrap-theme.css" /></code></pre>

				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The <code>rel="stylesheet"</code> tells us the type of link we've just added (called the link relation). The <code>href=</code> tells us the address of the file (this is called the hypertext reference). We're using a stylesheet called 'Bootstrap', made by Twitter. It's a free and easy way to style your app.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Replace <code><%= yield %></code> with:</p>
					<pre><code> <div class="container">
  <%= yield %>
</div></code></pre>
					<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is used to divide your code into parts.</p>
					<p>You can also assign a class. This allows you to apply the same styling to all the things with this class. We've called ours 'container'.</p>
					<p><code><%= yield %></code> is a way of adding the unique content we'll have on each page into the container. This helps make sure our styling is consistent.
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We want to have a navigation bar at the top of our page, so that people using our app can find their way around. We also want to have a footer at the bottom of the page. In the same file, under <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> add:</p>
					<pre><code><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">The Idea app</a>
    </div>
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
        <li class="active"><a href="/ideas">Ideas</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav></code></pre>
				<p>This is the navigation bar</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Let's add the footer too. Before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>, add:</p>
					<pre><code><footer>
  <div class="container">
    Rails Girls 2014
  </div>
</footer>
<script src="//railsgirls.com/assets/bootstrap.js"></script></code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Finally, we're going to make some changes to the way our ideas display. We want to space them out a bit. Open <code>app/assets/stylesheets/application.css</code> and at the bottom, add:
					<pre><code>body { padding-top: 100px; }
footer { margin-top: 100px; }
table, td, th { vertical-align: middle; border: none; }
th { border-bottom: 1px solid #DDD; }</code></pre>
				<p>Make sure you save the file. There's a 'Save' button at the top of the text editor box.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>So, what did that CSS do?</p>
					<p><code>body</code> - this part is known as the selector and refers to the HTML element you wish to style.</p>
					<p><code>{ padding-top: 100px; }</code> - this part is known as the declaration; each declaration has a property which is the style attribute you wish to change <code>(padding-top)</code>, and an associated value <code>(100px)</code>.</p>
					<p>Declarations always end with a semicolon and declaration groups are always enclosed by curly brackets.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Let's start the server again, and check out our progress. In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails server</code></pre>
					<p>Open the preview on Port:3000 again.</p>
					<p>Don't forget to add '/ideas' to the end of the URL</p>
					<p>When you're finished looking, stop the server again by hitting CTRL + c.</p>
				</section>
				<!-- Images -->
				<section>
					<h2>Images</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In our app, we want to be upload images. At the moment, we can't do that.</p>
					<p>Rails has lots of useful add ons you can use. In programming, these are usually called libraries, but in Rails, we call them gems. Gems contain pre-written code and help to reduce errors and duplication in your code.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In your project menu, you'll see something called <code>Gemfile</code>. This has all the gems that came with the application we created.</p>
					<p>Open gemfile so you can edit it in the text editor. Under the line, add:</p>
					<pre><code>gem 'sqlite3'
gem 'carrierwave'</code></pre>
					<p>The <code>sqlite3 gem</code> interfaces with our database, and <code>carrierwave</code> makes it easier to upload images.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In the terminal, run:</p>
					<pre><code>bundle</code></pre>
					<p>This runs Rails' Bundler software, which fetches the gems you have added from the <a href="https://rubygems.org">https://rubygems.org</a> website, and installs them.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now, we can generate the code for uploading pictures. In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails generate uploader Picture</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Now, we need to customise the form we use for editing and uploading ideas.</p>
					<p>We're using the same bit of code to edit and upload. This is found in <code>app/models/idea.rb</code></p>
					<p>This code snippet is used in both <code>edit.html.erb</code> and <code>new.html.erb</code>, as the two forms are basically identical. This saves us some work! If you look at either of those pages, rather than form code, it just says <code><%= render 'form' %></code></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Open <code>app/models/idea.rb</code>. Under the line <code>class Idea < ActiveRecord::Base</code>, add:
					<pre><code>mount_uploader :picture, PictureUploader</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Open <code>app/views/ideas/_form.html.erb</code>. This file creates our form HTML.</p>
					<p>At the top, you'll see <code>form_for(@idea)</code>. This starts our form code for the idea form.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Find <code><%= f.text_field :picture %></code> and change it to:</p>
					<pre><code><%= f.file_field :picture %></code></pre>
					<p>This changes the code from asking for a text input to asking for a file input, which makes it easier for our users to upload an image.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<p>Did you get an error?</p>
						<p><a href="#" class="navigate-right">No.</a></p>
						<p><a href="#" class="navigate-down">Yes</a>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In <code>app/views/ideas/_form.html.erb</code>, change <code><%= form_for(@idea) do |f| %></code> to:</p>
						<pre><code><%= form_for @idea, :html => {:multipart => true} do |f| %></code></pre>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
						<p>In the terminal, start the server again by typing:</p>
						<pre><code>rails server</code></pre>
						<p>Refresh the browser window you're viewing your app in to see the changes, and add a new idea.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>You'll notice that the image didn't display - instead, it showed the path to the image. Let's fix that.</p>
					<p>Open <code>app/views/ideas/show.html.erb</code> and change <code><%= @idea.picture %></code> to:
					<pre><code><%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url, :width => 600) if @idea.picture.present? %></code></pre>
					<p>Refresh your browser, and you should now see the image.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<p>Want to know more about what that code change did?</p>
						<p><a href="#" class="navigate-right">I'm good; let's keep going.</a></p>
						<p><a href="#" class="navigate-down">Yes, please! Explain what this code means.</a>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Let's take a closer look at <code>app/views/ideas/show.html.erb</code></p>
						<p>
						In the code <code><%= @idea.picture %></code>, @idea is what we call an 'instance variable'. Instance variables are start with an @ symbol. Each view file (what we're looking at now), has a corresponding controller action, where the instance variables' are set.</p>
						<p>In our code, @idea is set in the ‘show’ action of the Ideas controller. It's set with the code <code>@idea = Idea.find(params[:id])</code>.</p>
						<p>This allows us to use it in the view <code>show.html.erb</code>. It uses the Rails 'Find' method to get the ideas for our app from our database.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The code that follows the <code>@idea</code> variable (<code>.picture</code>) tells Rails to access the ‘picture’ attribute of our resource (idea). </p>
						<p>Our new code, <code><%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url...)</code>, uses the Ruby image_tag helper. This gives us an HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, but retrieves the image we want to display from the folder 'public/images' where our uploaded images are stored.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We also set a default width for each image (<code>:width => 600</code>).</p>
						<p>The final part of that line of code, <code>if @idea.picture.present?</code> checks if there is an image available before executing the rest of the code in this file.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<!-- Routes -->
				<section>
					<h2>Fine-tuning the routes</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>One part of our app's job is to listen to requests from the browser and return the correct information. In Rails, we have a system called 'routing' that does this.</p>
					<p>The browser requests information using HTTP* methods. There are four main methods it uses:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>GET</li>
						<li>PUT</li>
						<li>POST</li>
						<li>DELETE</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p><small>*HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) defines how information is formatted and transmitted on the Internet</small></p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Rails' routing system ensures the app knows what to do when it receives each of those methods for any of the resources in your app.</p>
					<p>For example, <code>GET /ideas/new</code> will give you the form for adding a new idea.</p>
					<p><code>POST /ideas</code> will create a new idea</p>

					<p>We're going to change some of the routes we have set up. When you open the Localhost:3000 page, it still has the Ruby 'Welcome Aboard' message. We had to manually go to /index.</p>
					<p>Open <code>config/routes.rb</code>. After the first line, add:</p>
					<pre><code>root :to => redirect('/ideas')</code></pre>
					<p>This changes the default page (root) that is returned when a browser requests your app to the /ideas page. Try it out now (don't forget to save your changes first, and restart the server if you've stopped it).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Lastly, we're doing to add a static page to our app. This one is going to provide information about the author of the app - you!</p>
					<p>In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails generate controller pages info</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>This created a new folder called 'pages', which you can find under <code>app/views</code>.</p>
					<p>In that folder, you'll see a page called <code>info.html.erb</code>. Open it up.</p>
					<p>You can customise the information in this page. If you add /pages/info to your app URL now, you'll see this page.</p>
